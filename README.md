# Data-Science-Project-2

Project Name : Classification of Myocardial Infraction.


Steps we did while doing project:

1. Implemented data-preprocessing techniques to transform the raw dataset to a more useful one.

2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to get a better picture of the data.

3. Built a number of regression and classification models using multiple machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, SVM, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression etc.

4. Model and application deployment with the help of Flask
