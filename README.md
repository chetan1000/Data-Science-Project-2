Implemented data-preprocessing techniques to transform the raw dataset to a more useful one.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to get a better picture of the data.

Built a number of regression and classification models using multiple machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, SVM, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression etc.

Model and application deployment with the help of Flask
